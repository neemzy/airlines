# Airlines development log

- Generated Doctrine entities and related CRUD interfaces with Symfony's console component
- Installed [JMSSerializerBundle](https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSSerializerBundle)
- Set up a RESTful JSON API for task management through AJAX
- Set up a `Manager` class to refactor task operations
- Wrote unit tests for `Task` and `TaskManager` classes
- Created companion project [airlines-socket](https://github.com/neemzy/airlines-socket) to handle realtime UI updates
- Installed [TinyRedisClient](https://github.com/ptrofimov/tinyredisclient) and [socket.io-php-emitter](https://github.com/rase-/socket.io-php-emitter)
- Added bundle's own configuration file and made it accessible through the extension class
- Made Socket.IO `Emitter` available as a service
- Set up a `TaskListener` class to trigger socket emitting towards the configured host and port
- Set up a `ListenerResolver` class to keep using the `EventListener` as a service and gain control over its dependencies
- Set up a `TaskEmitter` class as a separate service to do the job, as using the `TaskManager` created a circular dependency (since the latter gets injected with Doctrine's `EntityManager`)
- Added avatar support for members by adding a `MemberListener` class handling image upload and deletion
- Installed [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and [react-colorpicker](https://github.com/stayradiated/react-colorpicker)
- Set up an `AbstractJsonController` and a `JsonMemberController` to be able to list members for a given board
- Installed [reqwest](https://github.com/ded/reqwest) and [promise](https://github.com/then/promise)
- Set up a `MemberManager` class to generate root API URLs for members in order to fetch their tasks
- Wrote React components
- Installed [jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) and configured `npm test` script to run it in the right directory
- Set up a `DateHelper` JS class to deal with date formats
- Installed [react-dnd](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd)
